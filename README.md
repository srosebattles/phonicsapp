This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app by Sarah Rose Battles is a capstone project of the Iron Yard's front-end engineering course.

Phonics App is an educational application created in response to a need for instructional apps that introduce phonics according to the latest research-based model. For example, this application introduces the alphabet in the order of the approximate frequency of each letter's most common phoneme. This is important for the emerging reader, because when letters are introduced in alphabetical order, some of the highest-frequency phomenes in the English language - such as s and t - are left until late in instruction.

This application contains not just the 26 letters of the alphabet, but in a more complete approach to phonics covers dipthongs and vowel combinations that are critical to becoming a successful reader. The app also includes levels for a learner to practice vowel sounds and the easily-confused letters B, D, P, and Q.
